# What Is Behaviour-Driven Development

Behaviour-driven development is based on the test-driven development. BDD can be taken as a special TDD which starts with Acceptance Test.

Beside the precedures which are obviously different from TDD and waterfall model, the toolchain used in BDD is also very different with other.

The most important includes:

1. The Acceptance Test is not written by coder, but by the client. (features and scenarios)

2. The Acceptance Test can be written in natural language, but not in programming languages.

3. The defination of the product is consistent with the code, testable and reliable through the whole life cycle of the product.

## Definition of BDD

## Agile testing, the philosophy behind BDD

1. human
2. less is more
3. fast iteration
4. testable
5. refactor

## The concept of behaviour-driven development

1. the outer and inner circles
2. cucumber and rspec

## Steps and processes of BDD

1. client spec
2. begin iter
3. write feature
4. falling the feature
5. pass the feature
6. refactor the code
7. end iter

## BDD softwares in different languages
